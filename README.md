These folders contains almost all possible 3 character combinations that can be formed with these letters:
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`

4 Letter combination is not yet completed. Please contribute!
I have added my python source code that i used to create the files to this repo.

There is 150 000 (150k) folders inside at the moment.
Can we get that to 200k in the next contribution?


## Todo:
+ Rather let the program save and access folder names in json format.


## HELP!

Hello, so i have a problem. I ran this program (and simialar file gens i made) on Windows (BAD IDEA). After, I recycled alot of files to free up storage space. Now my storage space is running out and everytime that i want to empty the recyle bin, the computer freezes. Im running out of storage space and i'd appreciate some help on what to do.
